            <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
            <p>My name is Nicholas Roberto and up to this point the majority of my working career has revolved around film. I developed a love for cinema as a child moving all over the globe due to my dad's Air Force job. As soon as I entered high school I began working on local independent films and after acrueing the necessary experience I was granted union membership to IATSE as a set electrician. In between set jobs I also worked for a company restoring vintage movie theaters and eventually opened an online business selling rare and out of print DVDs that I often sourced while traveling for work. Outside of film some of my interests include just about anything physical or outdoors <em>(hiking, biking, weight lifting, climbing, obstacle races, etc.)</em>, spending time with my 2 year old daughter <a link href="image/norapic.jpg">Nora</a>, cooking, reading, and beer festivals.
            My decision to shift careers to programming came shortly after my daughter was born and I realized that I would need to make some big changes to support my family. I spent some time trying to learn on my own and was excited about learning a skill that has an endless amount of application and creative possibility but hit a wall with self-study. Shortly after, I discovered Epicodus and i'm excited to continue with the program and see where it leads me.
